         <td>- My most favourite school i have experienced in my life. Most of my friends
             are from the same primary school and i even got lucky when i got place
             in the same class as my best friend.
             Well, the happiness does not last long, since i need to transfer to a new school due 
             my family is moving to a new house that was 40 minutes away.

<td>- SMK Seri Tanjung</td>
         <td>- PT3 (5As 2Bs 1Cs), SPM (6As, 1Bs, 2Cs, 1Ds)</td>
         <td>- I tried to fit in when i first enter the school but it took almost a year 
             for me to make friends. It's a whole new experience because the school is in
             the rural area and my old ones is located in town. When i was in the upper form, then 
             i started to make friends. A bonus for this experience, overall all of the teachers are great!

<td>- Universiti Teknologi Mara Cawangan Rembau</td>
         <td>- By far, its great and have a huge improvement compare in the school days</td>
         <td>- Easy to fit in with everyone when most of us are not recognizing each other
             and it is easy to get along with. Not a great experience, due to covid i can't 
             make any memorable memories and stuck at home until my last semester. Also the stress
             that all of us gain is unbearable but thanks to the lecturer they do ease the burden.
