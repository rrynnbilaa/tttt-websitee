     </ol>
     <li>My hobby is reading books to be precise novels. I prefer fiction the most as it is more interesting</li>
     <li>I'm not really good in mathematics hence i further my studies in Information Management Course</li>
     <li>I grew up as the oldest in the family, and guessing from where i stand, it helps me to be more matured.</li>
     <li>I like coffee as it can give more energy throughout the day although taking to much caffeine can affected your health</li>
     <li>I do have a lot of friends but the ones that i trust and comfortable are very little out of 100 people only 10 people i am close with</li>
